\textit{On the actual exam, each page would only have one or two questions. Point values are approximate.} 

\begin{questions}

    \question[10] % 1.2 #13
    Sketch the graph of $f (y)$ versus $y$, determine the critical (equilibrium) points, and classify each one as asymptotically stable, unstable, or semistable. Draw the phase line, and sketch several graphs of solutions in the $ty$-plane.

    $$\dydt = y^2(1-y)^2, \qquad -\infty < y < \infty$$

    \question[2] % 2.4 #5
    Determine (without solving the problem) an interval in which the solution of the given initial value problem is certain to exist. 
    
    $$(4-t^2)y'+2ty=3t^2, \qquad y(1) = -3$$


    % \question[5] % 2.7 #13
    % Solve the differential equation. $$t \, \dydt +y = t^2y^2$$
    
    \question[5] %3.3 #17
    The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix $A$ are given. Consider the corresponding system $\vec x \, ' = A \vec x$. 
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Sketch a phase portrait of the system.
        \item Sketch the trajectory passing through the initial point $(2, 3)$.
        \item For the trajectory in part (b), sketch the component plots of $x_1$ versus $t$ and of $x_2$ versus $t$ on the same set of axes.
    \end{enumerate}

    $$\lambda_1 = -1, \quad \vec v_1 = \spalignmat{-1;2}, \quad \lambda_2 = -2, \quad \vec v_2 = \spalignmat{1;2}$$
    

    \question[10] % 3.5 #5
    Determine the general solution of the system. Also draw a direction field and a phase portrait. Describe the behavior of the solutions as $t \to \infty$.
    
    $$ \vec x \, ' = A \vec x = \spalignmat{-1 -\frac{1}{2}; 2 -3}\vec x$$

    \question[5] % 4.2 21
    If the Wronskian of $f$ and $g$ is $t \cos tâˆ’\sin t$, and if $u= f+3g, v=f-g$, find the Wronskian of $u$ and $v$. 

    %\question[5] % 4.1 11
    %Write down the appropriate initial value problem based on the physical description.\\
    %\textit{A mass of 100 g stretches a spring 20 cm. The mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 5 cm/s. Assume there is no damping.}

    
    \question[10] %4.7 \#11

    $$F(s) = \frac{2(s-1)e^{-2s}}{s^2-2s+2}$$
    
    \question[10] Find the solution of the given initial value problem. Draw the graphs of the solution and of the forcing function.
    $$y''+y=f(t), \quad y(0) = 5, \quad y'(0) = 3, \quad f(t) = \begin{cases} 1, & 0 \le t < \pi/2 \\ 0 , & \text{else} \end{cases}$$

    \question[10] % 7.2 9
    For the system below a) identify all critical points, b) construct the linear system for each critical point, and c) classify the critical points of the linear system according to stability (stable, unstable, asymptotically stable) and type (saddle, proper node, etc).
