    To be continuous at a point a function \(f\), the value of the limit at the point must be equal for <b>ALL</b> paths approaching that point. Here, there are only three given paths.",
    "<b>False</b>
    $BR
    This conclusion is only true under the special condition from Clairaut's Theorem stating that if \(f_{xy}\) and \(f_{yx}\) are both be continuous, then \(f_{xy} = f_{yx}\) is true.",
    "<b>True</b>
    $BR
    For each contour line, we express it as \(f(x,y) = k\) for some arbitrary \(k\). Since we know the contour is always a line, we know the equation is in the form of \(ax + by + c = k\) for all contours. If we then swap out the \(k\) for \(z\), we can see that it is the equation for a plane.",
    "<b>True</b>
    $BR
    Observe that \(<f_x, f_y, 1>\) is the normal vector to the tangent plane to the surface. By definition the normal vector is perpendicular to the tangent plane and therefore is perpendicular to the surface as well.",
    "<b>True</b>
    $BR
    Plug the values in the curve into \(f\) and observe that the equality holds true.",
    "<b>False</b>
    $BR
    Although the upper bound is true because \(D_u\) is maximized in the direction of the gradient (\(<2, 0>\) at point \((1,0)\)) meaning \(D_{<1, 0>}f(1, 0) = 2\), the minimum is false. Take the counter example where \(u = <-1, 0>\). Then \(D_uf(1,0) = \nabla f|_{1,0} \cdot <-1, 0> = <2, 0> \cdot <-1, 0> = -2\)",
    "<b>False</b>

    Although the gradient being 0 at the point lets us know it is a critical point, we do not know its classification. In addition to being a maximum and minimum, it can also be a saddle point.",
