      "\"explanation\": \"According to the definition of differentiability, if $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at point $(x_0,y_0)$, it must satisfy the condition that for all points $(x,y)$ in a $\\delta$ disk around $(x_0,y_0)$, we can write $f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + fx(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + fy(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0) + E(x,y)$, where the error term $E(x,y)$ satisfies $\\lim_{(x,y)\\rightarrow (x_0,y_0)} E(x,y)(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=0$. This implies that for all points $(x,y)$ in a $\\delta$ disk around $(x_0,y_0)$, we can write $f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + fx(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + fy(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0) + E(x,y)$ with $E(x,y)\\rightarrow 0$ as $(x,y)\\rightarrow (x_0,y_0)$. Therefore, the condition is necessary for differentiability. Moreover, if this condition is satisfied, it is possible to define the partial derivatives $fx(x_0,y_0)$ and $fy(x_0,y_0)$ such that $\\lim_{(x,y)\\rightarrow (x_0,y_0)} E(x,y)(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=0$, which implies that $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at point $(x_0,y_0)$. Hence, the condition is also sufficient for differentiability. For example, consider a function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ defined in a neighborhood of $(1,1)$. To check if $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at point $(1,1)$, we need to verify that for all points $(x,y)$ in a $\\delta$ disk around $(1,1)$, we can write $f(x,y) = f(1,1) + 2(x-1) + 2(y-1) + E(x,y)$ with $E(x,y)\\rightarrow 0$ as $(x,y)\\rightarrow (1,1)$. This is indeed the case because $\\lim_{(x,y)\\rightarrow (1,1)} E(x,y)(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=0$, which implies that $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at point $(1,1)$.\"\n",

A curve is simple if this parameterization is one-to-one over the interval $[a,b]$. While it's possible for a curve to be closed (i.e., have a loop), it's not necessarily simple, as long as the loop doesn't cross itself. For example, consider a figure-eight shaped curve. It's closed because you can traverse it once and return to your starting point, but it's not simple because the two loops intersect each other.\"\n",

      "\"explanation\": \"According to the definition, a surface parameterization is considered smooth if the vector product of the partial derivatives with respect to u and v, ru × rv, is non-zero for all u and v in the parameter domain. This means that the parameterization must have some 'bendiness' or 'twistiness' at every point in the domain. For example, consider a sphere parameterized by r(u,v) = 〈u cos(v), u sin(v), 0〉. In this case, ru × rv is non-zero for all u and v, so the surface is smooth. On the other hand, if we have a flat plane parameterized by r(u,v) = 〈u, 2v, 0〉, then ru × rv will be zero everywhere, making the surface not smooth.\"\n",
