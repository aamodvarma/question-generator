Question 1
The dot product of vectors u = 〈u1, u2, u3 〉 and v = 〈 v1, v2, v3〉 is given by the sum of the products of the components ie. u * v = u1v1 + u2v2 + u3v3

Question 2
The dot product of two vectors is the product of the magnitude of each vector and the cosine of the angle between them: u· v = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ.

Question 3
The nonzero vectors u and v are orthogonal vectors if and only if u· v = 0.

Question 4
The angles formed by a nonzero vector and the coordinate axes are called the direction angles for the vector. The cosines for these angles are called the direction cosines

Question 5
Let u and v be vectors, and let θ be the angle between them. Then, ‖ u × v ‖ = ‖ u ‖ · ‖ v ‖ · sin θ.

Question 6
If we locate vectors u and v such that they form adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then the area of the parallelogram is given by ‖ u × v ‖

Question 7
The triple scalar product of vectors u, v, and w is u · (v × w).

Question 8
The volume of a parallelepiped with adjacent edges given by the vectors u, v, and w is the absolute value of the triple scalar product: V = |u· (v × w)|

Question 9
Let L be a line in space passing through point P with direction vector v. If M is any point not on L, then the distance from M to L is d = ‖ PM × v ‖ / ‖ v ‖

Question 10
Given a point P and vector n, the set of all points Q satisfying the equation n· PQ→ = 0 forms a plane. The equation n · PQ→ = 0 is known as the vector equation of a plane.
