This third variable is called the parameter. In this context, x and y are functions of t, meaning that their values change as t varies within the interval I.\\n\\nTo illustrate this concept, consider a curve in the plane defined by the equations:\\n\\nx(t) = 2t{\\\\textasciicircum}2 + 3t\\ny(t) = t{\\\\textasciicircum}3 - 4t\\n\\nHere, x and y are both functions of the parameter t. As t changes within some interval I, the values of x and y change accordingly, describing a specific curve in the plane.\\n\\nIn summary, parametric equations are used to describe the relationship between two variables (x and y) as they vary with respect to a third variable (t), where t is the parameter.\\n                \\n                \\\\vspace{0.5cm} \\n        \\n            \",\n",

In fact, one of the fundamental properties of vectors is that they can be described in terms of both their size (magnitude) and orientation (direction).\\n\\nTo illustrate this, consider a displacement vector representing the distance between two points on a map. The vector's magnitude would represent the actual distance traveled, while its direction would indicate the path taken to get from one point to another.\\n\\nIn contrast, a quantity with only magnitude but no direction would not be a vector in the classical sense.

If the initial point of A is placed at the terminal point of B, this creates a new vector C. The initial point of C will be the same as the initial point of A, not the terminal point of B.

This means that every loop in the region can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the region. Since the region is connected, there are no separate components for loops to get stuck in. Furthermore, if the region had holes, some loops would have to stay outside these holes, contradicting the definition of simply connected. Therefore, the statement is true: a simply connected region in 2D must be both connected and have no holes.\\n                \\n                \\\\vspace{0.5cm} \\n        \\n            ',\n",

The unit normal vector N gives us the direction perpendicular to the surface at each point, allowing us to measure this flux correctly.
